# ü´Å Pneumonia Detection using CNN-Based Feature Extraction

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-based pneumonia detection system developed as part of the **Seminar and Communication Skills** subject at **Sanjivani College of Engineering**, Kopargaon, for the academic year 2024‚Äì2025. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically **DenseNet-169**, for feature extraction from chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia cases with high accuracy.

## üìå Abstract

Pneumonia is a life-threatening respiratory infection, especially in underdeveloped regions where expert radiological diagnosis is not always available. This project aims to build an automated diagnostic system using deep learning, specifically CNNs, to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model employs DenseNet-169 for robust feature extraction and utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for final prediction, achieving excellent accuracy and reliability while reducing diagnostic delays. The system is designed to be scalable and deployable in real-world healthcare environments, especially in resource-constrained settings.
